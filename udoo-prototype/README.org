* Notes

This is the original version of the v128 system, in prototype form. This system
uses an x86-based UDOO single-board-computer as the main workhorse. The screws
have no metal inserts to screw into, and screw directly into the plastic.

These parts are designed to be 3D printed using a 0.2mm layer height. The front
piece should be printed with the facia facing the print bed. The top-piece
should be printed on-end, vertically.
